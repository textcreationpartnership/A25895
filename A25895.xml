            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Neglect of Catechiſing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by a great many; and even by ſome of them who add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Cauſe of the Complaint. The Miſchiefs of which Neglect will ſoon appear as great now, as ever: For the numerous Enemies of the beſt eſtabliſh'd Church in the World, are all at work, and with united Voices crying, <hi>Down with it, down with it,</hi> to the Ground.</p>
            <p>One of the beſt Remedies that I know of, next to our Prayers and Tears, for its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, is to take great Care that our Youth be well inſtructed in the Principles of that holy Religion which we profeſs; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Self-denial, or Pains, or Difficulties, or Humility, or Condeſcenſion, or letting down of our ſelves, it coſt us.</p>
            <p>I have found by my own Experience, that
<pb facs="tcp:62664:3"/>to do it well and conſcionably has more of all theſe in it, than Preaching it ſelf; and when all is done, it ſhall pleaſe much leſs.</p>
            <p>But when I conſider that my Buſineſs is to pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> and not <hi>Man,</hi> and that my Hopes and Conſolations, will at laſt reſult from my having with <hi>Purity of Intention,</hi> deſigned the <hi>Former,</hi> more than the <hi>Latter:</hi> When I conſider that a poor Soul placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Charge and Conduct, for whom the great Lover of Souls, has provided no other Ordinary Means of Salvation, but what is to be conveyed to him by me, by my Aſſiſtances and Miniſtration, if it ſhould want theſe too, it will have none; and may for ever be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for me: When I conſider, that when he admitted me to cultivate a corner of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, as he did me a greater Honour than he did thouſands of others, ſo he expected more Glory, more Love, and more Obedience from me too, that he might confer on me a peculiar Coronet of Glory: When I conſider that he never meant the Miniſtery to be a Station of Eaſe and Indiligence: When I think how reaſonable a thing 'tis that I ſhould ſhed ſome of the Sweat of my Brows for them, for whom he was well contented to ſhed the Blood of his heart.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62664:3"/>
            <p>When I in a cloſe and piercing thought, reflect on theſe things; I find I can be content with that Contempt and Scorn, thoſe Pains and Difficulties, that Self-denial and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condeſcenſion, which will moſt times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the conſcionable Diſcharge of this very uſeful, and very neceſſary Duty.</p>
            <p>It were well if the Devout Paſtor, would ſometimes, when he is retired and with-drawn from the World, with pious Emotions, and devout Affections, with panting, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, languiſhing Aſpirations, ſay as St. <hi>Peter</hi> thrice did, <hi>John 21.15, 16, 17. Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> but in the ſame devout and affectionate thought to imagine he hears the holy Jeſus giving him the ſame Anſwer, <hi>Feed my Lambs:</hi> And then that he would pleaſe to conſider whether his Love of Jeſus would permit him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, well pleaſed and eaſie, while he refuſes to give him this his own way of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both <hi>That</hi> and his Obedience.</p>
            <p>If any plain Man, who is a Maſter or a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; an Houſholder or Guardian; and who has (in part) that great Truſt committed to him of the Care of a Soul, ſhall derive any Aſſiſtances, or Intimations for its Conduct
<pb facs="tcp:62664:4"/>and Inſtitution, from this Book, I do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly requeſt the Good Man to put me into his Litanies; and that his Prayer for the Author may be this: That my Paſſage over the World being ſafe and holy, I may come to ſit at the Feet of them, who with primitive Affections have loved and obeyed Jeſus, in the Manſions of Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>THE meaning is: They promiſed for me, what I ſhould have promiſed for my ſelf, had I been of Age; but ſeeing I was not, and they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it, I will now ſtand to it: And ſo I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I muſt, if I hope to receive the Benefits of my Baptiſm. Theſe were then the Three Things they promiſed, which follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They promiſed, <hi>I ſhould renounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil.</hi> The <hi>Pomps of the World,</hi> that is, all that Pride, Vain-glory, and Exceſs that is in the World, in Food, Raiment, or any thing elſe. All vain and ſinful Companies and Cuſtoms of the World. All the Temptations of the World. All that is vain or wicked in the World. All that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the World that is Enmity with God. All things of the World that may be an occaſion of ſin to me. All the unlawful Riches, Honours, or Pleaſures of the World; and never <hi>greedily to ſeek,</hi> or <hi>ſet my heart upon</hi> thoſe that are lawful. Thus they renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for me the Pomps and Vanities of the World, which was the firſt thing they renounced in my name.</p>
                  <p>The next was, <hi>All the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> That is, all the evil Affections, ſinful Deſires, and unlawful Luſts of my corrupt Heart: By no means either to be led by them, to yeild to them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them.</p>
                  <p>The other Branch of what they renounced in my name, was, <hi>The Devil and all his Works.</hi> Which works are; Lying, Envying, Slandering,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62664:30"/>Pride, Murder, Hatred, but eſpecially tempting others to ſin. And the actual committing, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual living in any one wilful known ſin. Thus in this ſenſe they promiſed,</p>
                  <p>I ſhould renounce

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Renunciation of all theſe, was the <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi> things they did for me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they preſented me to Baptiſm, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing they did for me, was, they promiſed in my Name, That <hi>I ſhould believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning is: They promiſed in my Name, that I ſhould believe all the Parts of the Chriſtian Religion; which are briefly contained in the Creed. That is, they promiſed I ſhould believe in God, and I do now believe in him.</p>
                  <p>They promiſed I ſhould believe in Jeſus Chriſt and I do firmly believe in him. That he was born of a Virgin, was crucified, died, and roſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which I ſtedfaſtly believe. They promiſed, I ſhould believe the Reſurrection of the Body, and a Life eternal after Death. And I firmly believe theſe, and all other Parts of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That I ſhould believe theſe things, was the ſecond thing they did for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They promiſed in my name, That <hi>I ſhould keep God's holy Will and Commandments, and walk in them all the days of my Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning is: When they preſented me to Baptiſm, they promiſed in my Name, That I ſhould obey God's Will, in <hi>avoiding</hi> all thoſe things which he hath <hi>forbidden</hi> me; and in <hi>performing</hi> all thoſe things he hath <hi>commanded</hi> me: And to do this, not for a day only, or a year, but <hi>all the days of my Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62664:31"/>
                  <p>Thus for inſtance, 'Tis God's Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that I ſhould be Sober, Temperate, Chaſt, Pure, Juſt and Upright; Repent of, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Sins; believe in Chriſt; be a very chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Perſon. That I ſhould be meek, humble and peaceable; ſelf-denying and mortified; fear him, love him above all things, truſt in him, be patient in Afflictions, ſubmitting to his Will and to his Wiſdom; attend upon his Ordinances, attend upon his Word, attend upon Prayer, attend upon his holy Sacraments, and perform all other parts and inſtances of my Duty to God, to my ſelf, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: This is to keep his holy Will and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>So that they who preſented me to Baptiſm, and charitably brought me to be received into Chriſt's Church by it, promiſed (in ſumm) theſe things in my Name.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I ſhould renounce the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, ſo as by neither of them to be led to any known Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That I ſhould believe the Chriſtian Religion, and live according to that belief.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That I ſhould give God one ſhort life of Love and Obedience, in ſincerely (though imperfectly) doing what he has commanded.</p>
                  <p>As they promiſed this in my Name <hi>before</hi> I was baptized, ſo I am now to keep it <hi>afterward;</hi> that after death I may enjoy the Promiſes of God (which he has made me upon theſe three Conditions) in a joyful Reſurrection, and an eternal Life of Glory.</p>

                  <p>THE meaning is: As they promiſed theſe things in my name (or for me) when I was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and could promiſe nothing for my ſelf; ſo, I do now heartily own them all, and take them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon my ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I will, and do renounce what they promiſed in my Name to renounce.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I will, and do believe firmly, what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in my Name I ſhould believe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I will ever (by divine aid) keep that holy Will, and thoſe Commandments of my God and Saviour, which they promiſed in my Name I ſhould.</p>
                  <p>And I bleſs God that he hath in infinite Love to me, and Compaſſion to my Soul, called me to this hope, this great hope of being ſaved when I die: And I earneſtly beg his Grace, that I may continue in this Faith, this Hope, this Love, and this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, till the end of my Life; till I change Worlds, and come up to him.</p>

                        <p>I believe that (the World being diſſolved, and the Earth and all things thereon, being burnt up) the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſit in the Air in a Glorious
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62664:35"/>Throne, and ſhall <hi>judge the quick;</hi> that is, all thoſe that ſhall be alive at his Coming; <hi>and the dead,</hi> that is, all thoſe that were dead before, ſince the World began. That the Records of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall be laid open; that is, all that ever they thought, or ſpake, or did, ſhall be brought to their Memory.</p>
                        <p>I believe firmly, That he will judge them Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly; and them that have lived unholily, irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, and died impenitently, he ſhall ſentence to eternal Darkneſs: But them that have believed in him, repented of, and reformed their Sins, and lived holy and good lives, he ſhall adjudge to dwell with him in Heaven and Happineſs for ever. And thus I believe <hi>he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead.</hi>

                        <p>THE meaning is: I firmly believe, That the Third Perſon in the adorable Trinity the Holy Ghoſt [or Holy Spirit] is God, as well as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. I believe him to be a Perſon diſtinct from both the Father and the Son, eternally proceeding from both, and equally ſent by both, and joint Author with both, of our Salvation: That though theſe are Three Perſons, yet are they but One God; and though this cannot be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this World, yet I believe it firmly.</p>
                        <p>I believe, That as God the Father created me, and God the Son redeemed me; ſo this God, the Holy Ghoſt, or Holy Spirit, ſanctifies me; offers me his Grace and Aſſiſtance to do the Will of God; is my Comforter, and always 'tis he that puts into my Mind good Deſires, and pious Purpoſes. So that I believe intirely, that he is not only of perfect
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62664:35"/>Holineſs in himſelf, but alſo that he is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cauſe of all Holineſs in us; that by him all the Servants of God are enabled to do all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, which by the force of Nature they cannot do: That 'tis he who enlightens our Underſtandings, ſanctifies our Will, orders and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our Affections; that 'tis by his Aſſiſtances imparted to us, that we ſpeak, or do any thing of our Duty.</p>
                        <p>Thus I believe God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, not to be Three Gods; but Three Perſons, and but One God: And though I ſhall never in this Life, fully comprehend this Myſtery of the Trinity, yet I firmly believe it.</p>
                        <p>And thus <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                        <p>THE meaning is: I do freely profeſs to believe, That Jeſus Chriſt did, by the Preaching of the Apoſtles, gather unto himſelf a Church, conſiſting of Thouſands of beliving Perſons, to which he dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, and will ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and daily add to the ſame, to the End of the World. That this Catholick (that is, Univerſal) Church, is the Corporation, or general Family of all true Believers: Or, that Body or Society of Perſons that profeſs Chriſt and his Goſpel; and is governed and continued under Biſhops and Paſtors lawfully called to that Office; by whom the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are duly Preached, and adminiſter'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt their Head.</p>
                        <p>I firmly believe this Church of Chriſt to be <hi>One, Holy,</hi> and <hi>Catholick. One,</hi> in reſpect of our Faith; <hi>One,</hi> in reſpect of the Sacraments; <hi>One,</hi> in reſpect
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62664:36"/>of being guided and directed by the ſame Spirit; <hi>One,</hi> in reſpect of One and the ſame Head, Chriſt Jeſus; and <hi>One,</hi> in reſpect of the ſame Hope of Glory and Immortality. <hi>Holy,</hi> in reſpect of its Head, the Holy Jeſus; <hi>Holy,</hi> by baptiſmal Dedication; <hi>Holy,</hi> in reſpect of its Deſign and End; <hi>Holy,</hi> in reſpect of the Holy Offices performed in it, all which tend to produce Holineſs; and <hi>Holy,</hi> in reſpect of its Calling, Profeſſion and Hope. <hi>Catholick,</hi> in reſpect of that <hi>Catholick</hi> Faith, Truth, and Doctrine which it teaches. <hi>Catholick,</hi> or Univerſal, in reſpect of that Univerſal Obedience, which it obligeth all Men to. <hi>Catholick,</hi> in reſpect of time, that is, it ſhall univerſally be continued to all Ages to the End of the World. <hi>Catholick,</hi> or Univerſal, becauſe 'tis made up of all the particular Churches in the World. <hi>Catholick,</hi> in reſpect of that univerſal War, which it always is to hold againſt all its Ghoſtly Enemies. <hi>Catholick,</hi> or Univerſal in this Senſe, that it is not limitted or confined to one Nation, as the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, but by the Command and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Chriſt, to be ſpread abroad, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from all Nations under Heaven.</p>
                        <p>I believe, That of this <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, part is on Earth, and part in Heaven; that is, the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted are the triumphant part of the Church; and all true Believers, Lovers and Obeyers of Jeſus, are the Church Militant.</p>
                        <p>And, as I ever deſire to be a Member of this Holy Catholick Church, ſo I believe there is and ought to be a <hi>Communion of the Saints</hi> in it; that is, a Society or Fellowſhip one with another, in all Holy Things: As all Saints on Earth, or all true Believers, have in common One God, One Chriſt, One Holy Spirit; One Lord, One Faith, One Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: So, I believe they ever did and ought to keep
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62664:36"/>up a Holy Fellowſhip or Society with each other, in all the common Chriſtian offices and duties, in Faith, in profeſſing the Goſpel, in hearing the Word, in receiving the Sacraments, in Charity and doing good to each other, and in all common Chriſtian offices of Piety and Devotion. And I ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am perſwaded that while the Saints, or true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on Earth do thus ſtedfaſtly keep up this Communion with each other in all holy things; in Faith, and Worſhip, Love and Obedience, they all have a <hi>Communion</hi> or Fellowſhip with the Bleſſed Trinity, with the holy Angels, and with the Saints departed.</p>
                        <p>So that as I am a member of Chriſt's <hi>Catholick</hi> or Univerſal Church, ſo I ever deſire to keep <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> or Fellowſhip with them in all Holy Things, and that as Chriſt is our Common Head, and we his Members, and I never withdrawing my ſelf from this Communion; ſo, my Faith may be accepted with theirs; my Prayers offered up with theirs; my profeſſion of the Goſpel may appear with theirs; my Duty, Love, and Obedience may be accepted with theirs, in the Day of the Lord Jeſus. And thus I believe <hi>the Holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints.</hi>

                        <p>THE meaning is: I believe that whereas every Sin, whether of Thought, Word, or Action is a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, and for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tranſgreſſion the Sinner is liable to Eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the infinite Juſtice of God: Yet that God in his unſpeakable Mercy, gave his Son Jeſus, and the Son gave himſelf, to become a Surety for this Debt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62664:37"/>of ours, and did offer up himſelf a Sacrifice, by his Death, to God's Juſtice, and a ſatisfaction for us.</p>
                        <p>Thus reconciling God's puniſhing <hi>Juſtice</hi> with his pardoning <hi>Mercy.</hi> Provided, that the Sinner, who had choſen amiſs, choſen the ways of Sin and Death, would in Faith, and with Repentance and new Obedience, turn ſeaſonably to God, and chuſe better.</p>
                        <p>I firmly believe the firſt remiſſion is obtained by the Holy Sacrament of Baptiſm: All original and actual Sin, being there waſhed away, to every one that duly partakes of that Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>But whereas, alas! 'tis too true we have ſome way or other ſtained the white Robes which we had put on, when we came from the waters of Baptiſm; and becauſe every diſobedience ſince, is a receſſion, or going back from our Baptiſmal Purity; for all ſuch Sins, God in much Mercy through the death of Jeſus, hath given us the Covenant of Repentance. Which being but this: a turning from Sin to God, a laſting, durable ſtate of new Life and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he has promiſed through the Merits and the Death of Jeſus, that if I have but, this to offer up to him, from a ſincere and contrite Heart, it ſhall be accepted to my Pardon and Forgiveneſs; and he will be reconciled to me.

                        <p>THE meaning is: I do profeſs ſolemnly that I am fully perſwaded of this infallible truth, That as 'tis appointed for all Men once to die, ſo 'tis determined that all Men ſhall ariſe from death. That the Souls ſeparated, or parted from our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62664:37"/>are in the Hand of God and live; That the Bodies of the Dead, although turned to duſt, moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into aſhes, conſum'd in flames, or ſwallowed up of the waters, devoured by beaſts, or fiſhes, or any way ſcattered, ſhall be gathered together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; all the ſcattered duſt pack'd together, and in an inſtant be revived and come alive, by the Soul's being united to it again. The ſame Fleſh which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall live; the ſame Body which fell ſhall riſe; the ſame Soul infallibly be united to the ſame Body. So that the Soul and Body are parted aſunder by Death, yet at the laſt day they ſhall be joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the Reſurrection, and ſhall no more be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>And this Reſurrection I firmly believe ſhall be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal; of all Mankind, no Man ſhall be left in the Grave, or Dead. That this ſhall be at the end of the World, when Chriſt ſhall come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Trump ſhall ſound, or, when the Arch-Angel ſhall lift up his Voice like a Trumpet; the juſt, and unjuſt, ſhall both ariſe out of their Graves and live: The Juſt ſhall ariſe to the Reſurrection of Life, and the Unjuſt to the Reſurrection of Damnation.

                        <p>This Precept of keeping Holy the Seventh Day, or Sabbath, is partly <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and partly <hi>Moral.</hi> Now the Ceremonial part of the Jewiſh Law is done away, but the Moral part of it is confirmed, perfected and compleated by the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part of this Commandment was, that God be publickly worſhipped preciſely on the Jewiſh Sabbath, or the Seventh Day.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Moral</hi> part of it is, That a certain and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined time be ſet out for the publick Worſhip of the Eternal God: And divine Love and Gratitude in us Chriſtians, ſhould engage us not to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the <hi>Jews</hi> in the return of our ſolemn Days of publick Worſhip. Nay, Equity requires we ſhould
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62664:44"/>ſet out One Day in the Week, to the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Glorification of God, and our religious Duties.</p>
                        <p>So that the Jewiſh Sabbath being aboliſhed; as they kept the Seventh Day in memory of the Creation, ſo the Apoſtles, and the Primitive Church, and all Ages of it ſince, kept the Firſt Day of the Week, in memory of our Lord's Reſurrection, and our Redemption.</p>
                        <p>For, as the Redemption of the World was a greater Mercy than the Creation of it: and, as God reſted from his Labours of the <hi>Creation</hi> on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day, and our Saviour reſted from his Laboure of the <hi>New Creation,</hi> or his Labours of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, on the Firſt Day of the Week, when he aroſe from the Dead; ſo the Apoſtles, and the Church in all Ages ſince, have ſet apart the Firſt Day of the Week (as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to ſet apart the Seventh) for the peculiar Worſhip, and Service, and Glorification of God.</p>
                        <p>That our Lord roſe from the Dead upon the Firſt Day of the Week, we ſee St. <hi>John</hi> xx. That the Diſciples aſſembled together on the Firſt Day of the Week, we are told St. <hi>John</hi> xx. 19. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and the Diſciples met to break Bread; that is, to receive the Sacrament, on the Firſt Day of the Week, we read <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 7. That the Holy Ghoſt deſcended on the Apoſtles on the Firſt Day of the Week, is certain, <hi>Acts</hi> ij. 1. And that Saint <hi>John</hi> expreſly calls it the Lord's-day, we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 10.</p>

                        <p>Their Seventh Day was kept by them, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the great Work of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World; our Firſt Day kept by us in memory of the greater work of its <hi>Redemption.</hi> Their Seventh Day called the <hi>Lord's Sabbath, Lev.</hi> xxiij. 38. and elſewhere in the Old Teſtament; our Firſt Day called the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> in the New, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 10.</p>

                           <hi>My good Child, know this, that thou art not able to do theſe things of thy ſelf, nor to walk in the commandments of God, and to ſerve him without his ſpecial Grace, which thou muſt learn at all times to call for by diligent Prayer. Let me hear therefore if thou canſt ſay the Lord's Prayer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE meaning is: That though theſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are to be kept and obeyed moſt ſincerely by us, yet of our ſelves we are not able to keep them, without his Grace: that is, without the gracious Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit to enable us, and give us ſtrength to keep them.</p>
                        <p>Now God will deny his Grace and Aid to none, who faithfully beg, and faithfully uſe it. We muſt therefore diligently employ, and uſe what we <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have,</hi> in labouring to keep his Commands: And we muſt daily beg <hi>more Grace</hi> of God by Prayer; in which we ſhould never leave out that Divine Prayer following, which was taught us by the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World.</p>

                     <p>In the firſt Sence, that is, by Creation, all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are thy Children: In the other Sence, we Chriſtians were made thy Children, by our Holy Baptiſm.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: We pray that God would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us and others, to obey his Will, or do what he Commands, with that Love, that Zeal, that Readineſs, that Chearfulneſs, that Sincerity, Univerſality and Conſtancy, as may make our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience like the Holy Angels above in Heaven.</p>

                     <p>That ſeeing by our own Induſtry alone we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not procure the outward Comforts of this Life, he would ſo bleſs that Induſtry, as to give us what may conveniently ſupport and ſuffice us here; and bear our Charges to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>That ſeeing theſe our Bodies are liable to hunger and thirſt, cold and nakedneſs, inconveniencies and dangers, wearineſs and want, he would by his providential Care, and fatherly Proviſion, ſupply

                        <hi>Our Bread;</hi> that is, that which is our own, by lawful Labour, or a lawful Title; and not the Bread of others.</p>

                     <p>BY Debts and Treſpaſſes, is meant Offences or Sins againſt God. So that the meaning is: We pray, that through the Satisfaction of the Holy Jeſus, we may be acquitted from the Guilt and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all our Sins, whether of Omiſſion or Commiſſion; thought, word or deed; known or ſecret.</p>

                     <p>But in this Petition here is a caution, or a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to be in us, whereby we may be capable of receiving God's Pardon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> That is, as we forgive them that have injured us, ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as not to deſire to revenge our ſelves on them: But, on the contrary, do endeavour ſincerely to love Enemies, and to do good upon all occaſions to them that hate us, whenever they need our relief, or aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Now although in weightier and conſiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we may ſeek and ſue for reaſonable Satisfaction for Damages and Injuries, yet if it be not done without rigour, ſpite, malice, and deſires of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, it cannot be lawful for a Chriſtian. If in this ſeeking ſatisfaction, and legal reparation, (where the Loſs and Damage is great and conſiderable) we give way to revengeful Deſires, or do it only to ſatisfie our revengeful Humour, it is ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                     <p>As for the Proſecuting a Malefactor, as Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Thief, Robber or the like, this is not made utterly unlawful by Chriſt, nor inconſiſtent with the ſafe and devout uſe of this Petition; provided it be not done barely to ſatisfie our own revengeful Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: But, in Obedience to the King, and the Laws who command it; for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, which is injured by the Impunity of Malefactors; for an example to others; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with Pity, Compaſſion, and Charity to the Perſon Proſecuted.</p>
                     <p>For although we may and ought to forgive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to our ſelves, yet we may not diſpoſe of the Rights of the Prince, and the Community: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in criminal Caſes the Plea is in the behalf of the King, and not the injured Perſon.</p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62664:57"/>
                     <p>So that (at leaſt) in greater Caſes not to Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, is Diſobedience to the King, a plain Breach of the Laws, and an Act of Injuſtice and Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to the Community. Further yet, 'tis a known Rule, That the Receiver is as bad as the Thief; and the Acceſſary, in ſome proportion, is puniſhable as the Principal; and the Concealer is certainly an Acceſſary. Though ſtill, when all is done, we ſhould have a very watchful Eye upon our ſelves, that we neither deſire, nor deſign the gratifying our own revengeful Humour, in ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions; and, to that end, alway labour to ſubdue and mortifie all ſuch vile Affections, as incline us to Revenge.</p>
                     <p>So that we pray in this Petition, that God would forgive us our Offences againſt him, as we forgive our Brethren, ſo as not to deſire to revenge our ſelves on them here, or that they may fare the worſe for their wrongs toward us in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>We pray alſo in this Petition for the Grace of Charity and Forgiveneſs: That God would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe us Hearts to forgive others their Offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, according as we expect forgiveneſs from God: That we may ſee and conſider the eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Pardon that is ſet us; to forgive our Brother a few Pence in this Life, to have Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Talents forgiven us in the next.</p>
                     <p>So that this Petition cannot piouſly and ſafely be uſed by us, unleſs we lay aſide all hatred, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and deſires of Revenge, towards our Brethren: And if ever, in Caſe of great and conſiderable Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, we do ſeek for legal Satisfaction, it ought to be without ſuch hatred, ſpite, and intentions of Revenge; and managed with a charitable and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temper and diſpoſition toward the Perſon, or elſe it cannot be innocent.</p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62664:57"/>
                     <p>Behold here the abſolute neceſſity of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Charity, Meekneſs and Self-denial, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and Forgiveneſs in a Chriſtian, or Diſciple of the Holy Jeſus; who cannot ſo much as ſue rightly for reparation or ſatisfaction for Loſſes and Damages done him by others, unleſs it be without hatred of the Perſon, and for conſiderable Matters, (not for trifles) and without Malice, Spite, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour or intentions of Revenge.</p>
                     <p>And may the good God grant us the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and the Practice both of the true Chriſtian Charity, and Meekneſs, that by this Character the Holy and Meek Jeſus may diſcern us to be his Sons and Servants: And that the difficulty of this Duty may never diſcourage us from the practice of it; eſpecially conſidering we are undone for all Ages, if we are not forgiven a thouſand times more by God than ever we can forgive our Brother: And conſidering too that we have ſuch glorious Rewards before us, that it is a ſhameleſs Impudence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo great Glories at a leſs rate than the bearing Chriſt's eaſie Yoke, and light Burthen; at a lower rate than one ſhort, but holy Life here.</p>

                        <hi>And lead us not into temptation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: We pray that the allurements of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, may be ſo reſtrained by God, that if we ſhould by any of them be tempted to ſin againſt him, he will not leave us to be overcome by the temptation, and fall into ſin by it: Or if at any time we ſhall fall into a ſin by their Temptations (which God forbid) we pray that we may not impenitently live in it.</p>

                     <p>That ſeeing we have vile Inclinations, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affections of our own, ready to betray us; ſeeing we have a tempting World ready to deceive us; and ſeeing there is a buſie, crafty, watchful Devil, that ſtudies to undoe us; and all of them conſtantly alluring us to Sin, or diſcouraging us from our Chriſtian Duties; we pray that God would not withdraw his Grace from us, ſo as to leave us to be overcome by them: But by the aſſiſtance of that Grace, by being always upon our guard, by holy Reſolutions, and a watchful Spirit, we may be enabled (when we are in danger, and are tempted) to reſiſt, ſubdue, and conquer the Temptation.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, we pray in this Petition, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are tempted, God would pleaſe either to reſtrain the Temptation, or give us Grace to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>

                     <p>THE meaning is: This is no Petition, but a praiſing and glorifying of God; that we may hence learn not only to pray for what we want, but return him Love, and Praiſe, and Adoration for what we receive, and the end of all may be his Glory.</p>
                     <p>So that as we begun this Prayer with Hallowed, or Sanctified, and Glorified be thy Name, ſo when we have begged of God all neceſſaries for our Souls and Bodies, we then conclude our Prayers with Praiſes, as it is fit we ſhould.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thine is the Kingdom.</hi> Thou art King, the great King of Heaven and Earth, and we are thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Vouchſafe us thy Subjects what we humbly petition for, and beg. Thou haſt commanded us, O our good and great King, to come to thy Throne of Grace and ask; and thou haſt ſaid, Ask and ye ſhall have: Be thou then intreated by us to hear and grant our Petitions.</p>
                     <p>For thine is the Kingdom, thine is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Dominion over all the World, and therefore haſt an infinite right to diſpoſe of all things.</p>
                     <p>Thine is <hi>the Power:</hi> That is thou art Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or able to do all things, and therefore ſure
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62664:59"/>able to grant what we humbly ask and ſue for. It were to no purpoſe to come and ask a thing of him that were not able to beſtow on us what we ſeek for: Here therefore we acknowledge God's infinite Power.</p>
                     <p>In all Requeſts or Suits, the two chief things to be conſidered in the Perſon we addreſs to, are theſe:
<list>
                           <item>1. That he be <hi>able</hi> to grant us: And,</item>
                           <item>2. That he be <hi>willing</hi> to grant what we beg for.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now here in the end of this Prayer, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to be <hi>able</hi> to grant, when we ſay <hi>Thine is the Power:</hi> In the beginning of it, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be <hi>willing,</hi> when we call him by the endearing name of <hi>Our Father;</hi> for what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not readily grant a Child what he ſees neceſſary for him?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we not only praiſe God, by aſcribing to him the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and Dominion over all the World, and by aſcribing to him the <hi>Power</hi> of being able to do all things, but by aſcribing to him all <hi>Glory</hi> and Honour. And this alſo is neceſſary in all our Petitions, not only becauſe God ſays, <hi>Them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me I will honour,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. but becauſe the right end of our Prayers ſhould be the Glory of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thine is the Glory:</hi> To thee we give Honour, Praiſe, and Adoration in theſe and all our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if thou pleaſe to anſwer our Petitions, and grant what we beg, to thee ſhall be returned the Praiſe and Glory for all Ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Amen,</hi> we declare our firm Belief that he <hi>can</hi> grant us what we pray for, and our earneſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62664:59"/>Hope, and fervent Deſire that he <hi>will</hi> do it, for the ſake of him, <hi>in whom all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen;</hi> even the Lord Jeſus.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>We pray unto God to ſend us all things needful both for our Souls and Bodies,</hi> when we ſay, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread.</hi>

                     <p>We requeſt him to <hi>be Merciful to us and forgive us our Sins,</hi> when ſay, <hi>And forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Two only, as generally neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: A Sacrament ſignifies a Holy Rite, or Ordinance, uſed in the Service of God. Now Chriſt, when he was upon Earth, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that two Sacraments only ſhould be neceſſary to be received by all Men in general, that would attain Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Now as all Mankind are firſt Born, and then grow up to full Stature: So by the firſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm we are new Born, and are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Chriſt's Church: And by the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper we are nouriſhed to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:62664:60"/>
                     <p>Again we are Born but once, but we are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed daily: So in this caſe we are baptized but once, Born anew but once; but we receive the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper frequently, as we have frequent need of Nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>Two Sacraments then Chriſt ordained, as the <hi>Seals</hi> of that <hi>Gracious Covenant,</hi> which through him was made between God and us; and as the means by which his Merits ſhould be conveyed and made over to us, and to all Believers to the end of the World: And therefore neceſſary to all Believers in general.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, God can ſave if he pleaſe without them: But ſeeing theſe are the <hi>Seals of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> (and what that is we ſhall ſee preſently) and the ordinary inſtrumental means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; willfully to neglect them, or want them when they may be had, is to neglect God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to diſobey his Command, and a manifeſt hazard of our own Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Some there are that have five Sacraments more; as, Confirmation, Confeſſion, Ordination, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Extream Unction. Now although our Church retains of all theſe as much as is neceſſary, or uſeful, and truly primitive; yet theſe two, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lord's Supper, only were by Chriſt made neceſſary for all Men in general to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>THE meaning is: A Sacrament is an <hi>outward Sign</hi> of an <hi>inward Grace</hi> and Favour. Thus for Inſtance in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the Perſon with Water (in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt) that is the outward Sign: But then the inward and ſpiritual Grace and Favour is this, That we receive pardon of Sin, and Grace (or Strength to do our duty) and are made God's Children, and have a right to Glory. Which we ſhall not fail of if we ſincerely perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that are required on our part.</p>
                     <p>So that a Sacrament (I ſay) is an outward Sign of an inward Favour beſtown on us. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but 'tis alſo a <hi>means and inſtrument</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying that favour to us; and beſides that 'tis a <hi>Pledge or Token</hi> of aſſurance that God has admitted us to his Favour, and his Love, and received us into the Covenant of Grace. Of which Covenant, if we perform our part, God will moſt ſurely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: In both theſe Sacraments (as we ſaid before) there is an outward part or ſign to be ſeen by the Eye; and an inward Grace and Favour to be received by Faith. Thus (as we ſaid) for inſtance in Baptiſm, the outward part to be ſeen by the Eye is the waſhing with Water, (<hi>in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c.) The inward Favour is this, That we are made Heirs of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62664:61"/>and received into the Covenant Grace. Which Covenant of Grace is; God promiſes Pardon of Sin, Grace here, and Glory hereafter, if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Conditions of the Covenant; which are, Faith, Repentance, and a ſincere Obedience.</p>

                     <p>THE meaning is plain: That the outward ſign in Baptiſm to be ſeen by the Eye, is Water; with which, according to Chriſt's Command, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.) we are baptized <hi>in the name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. And being ſo baptized, we are then made Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven: The guilt of original Sin is waſhed away: We are received into the Family of our Saviour, and if (while we continue in that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily) we believe firmly in Chriſt, repent of our Sins, and obey him, we ſhall not miſs of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to which we were then Intituled.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A death unto Sin, and a new birth unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: Before Baptiſm, we were guilty of Original Sin, and liable to the Wrath of God: But by Baptiſm the guilt of Original Sin is pardoned, we are dead to Sin, and we receive a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62664:62"/>new Birth unto Righteouſneſs: That is, we are endued with ſtrength and ability to <hi>live righteouſly,</hi> if we will diligently and faithfully make uſe of the Grace of God given us, and humbly beg for more; we are reſtored, and admitted to God's Favour, and have a title given us to glory in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>This is the benefit of our Baptiſm, this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Spiritual Grace. The Guilt (I ſay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) of Original Sin is pardoned, and done away; we receive Strength and Power to live righteouſly, in acceptable and evangelical degrees and meaſures; we are admitted into the Covenant of Grace, and are intitled to the Kingdom of Glory. But then there is ſomething to be performed on our part, and that follows in the next Queſtion and Anſwer.</p>

                     <p>THE meaning is: That Perſons to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed are to promiſe to diſcharge their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenant of Grace, which are, <hi>Faith and Repentance: Faith,</hi> or a firm Belief of Chriſt and his Goſpel, ſo as to live in a <hi>holy Obedience</hi> to it: And <hi>Repentance,</hi> that is, of renouncing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all Sin and Vice.</p>

                     <p>THE meaning is: They promiſe this <hi>Repentance,</hi> and this <hi>Faith</hi> which is to be ſhewn by a holy <hi>Obedience,</hi> by their Sureties, by their Mouths; which Promiſe if they will themſelves faithfully ſtand to, and take upon themſelves when they come to Knowledge, they ſhall receive all the Benefits that can be conveyed by the Holy Sacrament of Baptiſm: Their Baptiſm ſhall be as effectual, or in as full Power, Force, and Vertue, as any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Bargain, which was, or could be made for them, by their Truſtees or Guardians, when they were under Age: And if they perſevere in this Faith, and this Obedience, ſhall not fail to receive their Crown and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But yet notwithſtanding all this, this is the great Objection made by the Anabaptiſts againſt baptizing Infants, That they do not believe; can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing of the Chriſtian Religion, nor promiſe <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> for the future.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall therefore in a word or two (as we paſs along) ſhew, that Infants are to be Baptized, from Scripture (although it be not commanded there in expreſs Words); from the Practice of the Church of Chriſt, and from Reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to Scripture: That command given to the Apoſtles to baptize all Nations (who are no where forbidden to baptize the Children of Chriſtian Parents) ſeems to look favourably enough this way.</p>
                     <q>Thus when we read of a whole City, as <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> or a Family, as the Jaylor's, and <hi>Criſpus's,</hi> and <hi>Stephanas's,</hi> baptized, though none be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be baptized, but thoſe that believed; yet, what other can be thought, but that even the Children alſo of theſe Believers, if they had any in their Town or Family, were baptized? Since it was agreeable with the Jewiſh Baptiſm (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Saviour's was founded, and from which, in that particular it is never ſaid in the leaſt to have differed) to receive to Proſpelytiſm by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, the Infants of thoſe that were converted and baptized, as well as the Converts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</q>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scripture ſeems rather to command it, St. <hi>Mark</hi> x. 14. <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> Which intimates, that their coming to him was for entrance into that Kingdom, and to be made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church. And what, ſhall we forbid theſe to be brought to Chriſt, to come to him, whom he calls? God forbid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> ij. 38, 39. <hi>That Peter ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62664:63"/>For the Promiſe is unto you and your Children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When he here bad the Parents be baptized for the Remiſſion of Sins, can it be thought his meaning was, That the Children ſhould rather go without <hi>Remiſſion,</hi> than have Baptiſm? as if he had <hi>ſome</hi> compaſſion indeed for the Parents, but <hi>none</hi> for the Children. Ay, but he bids them Repent, which Children could not do. 'Tis hard-heartedneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and that to a high degree, for want of that Duty, which they have not need, nor ability to perform, to deprive them of that Benefit which they have need of, and capability to receive; to deny them the means of being made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt; who, as they do not act Repentance, ſo they need not to repent; and need not to repent, becauſe they act no Sin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To mention (among others) but one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vij. 14. <hi>For the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is ſanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband: elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> If Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of a believing Parent are Holy, ſurely then they have a right to Baptiſm: For none can be ſaid to be Holy without the Merits of Chriſt, and Baptiſm is the way to apply and convey Chriſt's Merits to us. Now that Infants of Chriſtian Parents, ſhould have a right to Chriſt's Merits and Holineſs, and yet no right to the means of conveying them, is not to be ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>As for what the Anabaptiſts object from St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> xxviij. 19, 20. that 'tis ſaid, <hi>Teach all Nations and baptize them,</hi> it makes little or nothing for them, but rather againſt them. For (1.) the word <hi>Teach</hi> is after the word <hi>Baptizing,</hi> as well as before it, and that makes the Caſe <hi>even.</hi> But (2.) the exact rendring of the place is this: <hi>Go ye therefore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62664:64"/>and make Diſciples of all Nations, baptizing them, In the name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>teaching them to obſerve all things,</hi> &amp;c. Now 'tis certain, there were Three things formerly in Uſe in the Jewiſh Church, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Diſciples, <hi>viz. Circumciſion, Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and our Saviour did lay aſide the Two former, Circumciſion and Sacrifice, and did think fit only to continue the latter, namely, Baptiſm. <q>Now put the Caſe he had continued Circumciſion to be the only Ceremony to be uſed in his Church for the admitting of Diſciples, and had laid aſide Sacrifice and Baptiſm;<note place="margin">See <hi>Walker's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Plea for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſm <hi>cap. 30. §. 15.</hi>
                           </note> and that inſtead of ſaying, <hi>Go ye therefore, and make Diſciples of all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. he had ſaid, <hi>Go ye therefore, and make Diſciples of all Nations, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing them,</hi> &amp;c. who then remembred that Infants, as well as others, had uſually in that Caſe been circumciſed, would ever have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Words, to the excluding of Infants from Circumciſion, or ever have once imagined or phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied any other, but that Children ſhould now, and henceforth, as well as formerly, be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. Even ſo now our Saviour having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Baptiſm</hi> alone, to be the Sacrament of the initiation of Diſciples into his Church; who that remembers that it was the uſe before our Saviour's time, to admit Infants into the Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, can imagine any other, but that his mind was, they ſhould ſtill be ſo admitted? or but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally phanſie, that in ſaying, <hi>Make Diſciples of all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> he meant to exclude Infants from Baptiſm?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:62664:64"/>II. As to the Practice of the Catholick Church. 'Tis now above Sixteen hundred and fifty Years ago ſince our Saviour, after he had wrought out our Redemption, aſcended up to Heaven. And in every Age of the Church, home to the very Age wherein the Apoſtles lived, Church-Hiſtories tell us, it was the Practice of the Church of Chriſt, to Baptize the Children of Chriſtian Parents; which has been continued to this Day. So that this Cuſtom is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or Univerſal in point of <hi>Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And no leſs Univerſal or Catholick is it in point of <hi>Place:</hi> For all Parts of the Church Militant on Earth (excepting the few <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of this and the laſt Age) ever did, and ſtill do Baptize their Infants: All Parts, both of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Church; the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; all that vaſt number of Chriſtians, that now inhabit in or near that Country where our Saviour was pleaſed to live, when he was here on Earth; all thoſe of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> who, as themſelves ſay, received their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from St. <hi>Andrew;</hi> all thoſe of <hi>India,</hi> who were converted to Chriſtianity by the Preaching of St. <hi>Thomas;</hi> all that ſort of Chriſtians called <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> who inhabit in <hi>Syria, Meſopotamia, Babylon</hi> and <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> and under other Titles are ſaid to be ſpread abroad in Forty Kingdoms; all the <hi>Cophti,</hi> or Chriſtians in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where Religion was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Apoſtles Days; all the <hi>Habuſtine</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians inhabiting the Midland of <hi>Africa;</hi> all the <hi>Armenian</hi> Chriſtians ſpread in Multitudes over the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; the <hi>Maronites,</hi> a Sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians inhabiting <hi>Aleppo, Damaſcus,</hi> and <hi>Mount Libanus</hi> and elſewhere, all conſent for the baptizing their Infants.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62664:65"/>
                     <p>To which I might add, nearer Home, all the Proteſtant Churches, as appears by the Harmony of the Confeſſions of <hi>Helvetia, Bohemia, Belgia, Auſpurge, Sweveland, Wittemberg, Saxony,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Confeſſion, all unanimouſly declaring for Baptizing Infants. Thus much for the Practice of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. A word or Two from Reaſon. Infants of Old in the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (which was the true Church before Chriſt's coming) were in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; which was a bleſſed Privilege and Favour: And what? have we loſt any Privilege by Chriſt's coming? any Favour by our Redeemer? any Mercy by the coming of the Holy Jeſus, the great lover of Souls? 'Tis Blaſphemy to ſay it, when we have got ſo many. They were by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in Covenant with God, at Eight Days old; and are we ſuch loſers by Chriſt's coming, that our Infants ſhall not be received into Covenant with God? Is it to be imagined, that our Saviour took away this Privilege? No ſurely. Beſides, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Anſwer in a Controverſie once was this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 16. <hi>If any Man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the Churches of God.</hi> So may we very fitly ſay in this Caſe; If any that name the Name of Chriſt, refuſe to Baptize their Infants, and <hi>ſeem to be contentious,</hi> we have no ſuch Cuſtom, neither the Churches of God.</p>
                     <p>Again, it may very rationally be asked, What, have Infants of Chriſtian Parents no Privileges at all, above the Infants of Heathens? Muſt our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants be Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, till they enter by choice and diſputation, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Heathens may? No ſurely. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy:</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>Acts</hi> ij. <hi>The Promiſe is to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62664:65"/>you and your Children:</hi> And therefore, if they have a Right to the Covenant of Promiſe, ſurely they muſt have a Right to the Seal of that Covenant, which is Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we may reaſonably ask, What, are there no Babes in Chriſt? Are all ſtrong Men? Can the Blood of Chriſt do Infants no good? Is there in them no Original Sin to be cleanſed? Or cannot the Blood of Chriſt cleanſe it? God forbid. What, no Lambs in Chriſt's Flock? Are all old Sheep that make up the Fold of which he is Shepherd? All this is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe. But thus much in few words, touching infant Baptiſm, from <hi>Scripture,</hi> from the <hi>Practice of the Church,</hi> and from <hi>Reaſon.</hi> But to return.</p>
                     <p>Well then, the firſt of the Two Sacraments, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Chriſt, and by him made neceſſary for all Men in general, to Salvation, is the Sacrament of Baptiſm. In this Sacrament there is an <hi>outward viſible Sign,</hi> and that is the waſhing the Perſon with Water, <hi>In the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. The inward Grace and Favour is, that the Guilt of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin is waſhed away: We have <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, Power and Strength given us to live the new Life of Righteouſneſs, in acceptable degrees and meaſures: We are reſtored to God's Favour; are received into the Covenant of Grace, made Members of Chriſt, Children of God, and Heirs to Glory. And all this upon condition, that we do afterward ſincerely and conſcionably perform our part of that Covenant; which is Faith, Repentance, and Obedience to the Will of God.</p>
                     <p>Now although this was promiſed in our Name by others when we were baptized, becauſe we could then promiſe nothing our ſelves, yet being now come to knowledge, we are thankfully to take theſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62664:66"/>advantageous Terms upon our ſelves, and perform theſe Conditions of Faith, Repentance, and a holy Love and Obedience: Then, according to God's Promiſe, we ſhall not fail of the Benefit of Baptiſm. But if we perſevere in this Faith and Obedience to the end of our Life, we ſhall, through Chriſt, find that we were truly made Heirs of his Kingdom in Baptiſm; and from his Kingdom of Grace here, paſs to his Kingdom of Glory, for all futurity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And thus much of the Holy Sacrament of Baptiſm.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>For the continual remembrance of the ſacrifice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: Our Bleſſed Saviour, beſides the Sacrament of Baptiſm, was pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute One Sacrament more, which is neceſſary to Salvation, for all Men in general, where it can be had.</p>
                     <p>By the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we are entred into Chriſt's Church, and admitted to his Favour. We are born again of Water, and of the Holy Ghoſt. By the Sacrament of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> we are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed up in our Chriſtian Faith; we commemorate the Death and Sufferings of our Saviour; we receive his Body and Blood to all intents and purpoſes whatever, to which he did ſpeak them ſo to be, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62664:66"/>to which he meant them, and deſigned them to us.</p>
                     <p>In the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we were firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Covenant of Grace with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we knew it: In the Sacrament now of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> we our ſelves in our own Perſons, ratifie and confirm this gracious Covenant, being come to knowledge: And as, ſince our Baptiſm, we have too often broken our part of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo we come humbly <hi>here</hi> to renew it with our God and Saviour. The Sacrament therefore of Baptiſm is to be adminiſtred (as we ſaid) but once; this being our New-birth, and we are born but once. But then the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is adminiſtred often, becauſe we have need of conſtant Nouriſhment, though we are born but once. We are admitted into the Covenant of Grace but once <hi>ſolemnly,</hi> and that is in our Baptiſm; but then, as we break it often (too often) ſo we have need to renew it often; and that is done (if we come aright) in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</p>
                     <p>Well them, Two things this other Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was ordained for. (1.) For a continual remembrance of the Sacrifice of Chriſt's Death. That as our Saviour offered up himſelf upon the Croſs a Sacrifice for the Sins of the World, ſo in this Sacrament we <hi>ſhew forth this his death till he come;</hi> we have a lively repreſentation of that Sacrifice, and he himſelf is effectually and <hi>really,</hi> but ſpiritually, given and exhibited to all worthy Communicants. And,</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) It was appointed for <hi>a Seal or Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>renewing of that Covenant of Grace,</hi> which God made with us, in and by Chriſt Jeſus: which is the great Benefit we receive by his Death. 'Tis true,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62664:67"/>we were (as I ſaid) admitted into this Covenant by Baptiſm; and 'tis as true, that we have ſince that time, by Diſobedience, broken our part of it: But here we are graciouſly admitted to confirm it; we renew it here. Here we come to own that though we are Sinners, yet we are no Apoſtates; have not fallen from the Chriſtian Faith. Here we come ſolemnly to own our Crucified Maſter; and to declare, that as we were admitted into a gracious Covenant with God in Baptiſm, ſo we now deſire to confirm it, deſire to renew it; humbly deſire to receive the benefit of it, to all Ages.</p>
                     <p>So that by coming to this laſt Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, for the conſtant remembrance of his Death for us, for the real and effectual receiving him; and for a renewing of the Covenant of Grace with God, we ſolemnly own whoſe we are, to whom we belong, what Religion we are Profeſſors of. We here moſt ſolemnly diſtinguiſh our ſelves from <hi>Jews, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans.</hi> We come to own and evidence ſolemnly to God, and the World, whoſe Name we profeſs and own, and upon whoſe account 'tis we hope Salvation. We come to own, for whoſe Death and Sufferings-ſake 'tis that we do humbly expect and hope to be bleſſed for ever, happy for ever, ſecure for ever, ſo ſit down in peace and glory for ever. We ſhew by frequenting it, upon whoſe account 'tis we humbly hope to be ſafe then, when the whole World ſhall be in Flames, and the Earth, with the Works thereof, ſhall be burnt up. Here we come ſolemnly to own upon whoſe account 'tis we hope to have all our Prayers heard; and to have our Obedience (though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) accepted, and all our religious Actions and Inſtance of Duty to be united to his Merits and his Interceſſion.</p>

                     <p>THE meaning is: As the outward part or ſign in the One Sacrament, is Water, wherein the Perſon is Baptized, <hi>In the name,</hi> &amp;c. So the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part or ſign of the Other Sacrament is Bread and Wine.</p>

                        <hi>Their</hi> Circumciſion was a <hi>painful</hi> way of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into Covenant with God. <hi>Their</hi> Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, Sheep, Goats and Lambs, were offered up in <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to him.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſtrengthening and refreſhing of our Souls, by</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: That all penitent, faithful, ſincerely worthy Communicants, are, by the receiving of the body and blood of our Saviour, <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> and <hi>refreſhed</hi> both. They are <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,</hi> by the Grace of God hereby conveyed to them; and they are <hi>refreſhed,</hi> by the comfortable hope of Pardon, and of being admitted to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Thus</p>
                     <p>By this heavenly Duty their Faith is <hi>ſtrengthened,</hi> by beholding the lively repreſentation of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour's Body broken, and Blood ſhed before their Eyes.</p>
                     <p>By this Duty their Hope is <hi>ſtrengthened,</hi> when they ſee before them what great Things Chriſt has done and ſuffered for their Salvation; how willing he is to be reconciled, and that now there is nothing wanting to their Pardon and Salvation, but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance, Reformation, and a perſevering new Obedience.</p>
                     <p>By this Duty their <hi>Love to God</hi> is <hi>ſtrengthened,</hi> by conſidering and beholding his Love to them, in ſending his Son to die for their Sins; and by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Love of Jeſus,</hi> in laying down his Life for their Redemption.</p>
                     <p>By this Holy Duty their <hi>Love and Charity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other is <hi>ſtrengthened:</hi> when we conſider how freely Chriſt laid down his Life for us all, and that we are all Members of his Body, how muſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62664:69"/>this needs unite us with Peace and Love, as we are Travelling on together to Jeſus and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this Duty our <hi>Repentance</hi> would be <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,</hi> and made more ſerious, deep, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering, when we behold what bitter ſufferings our Iniquities brought our Jeſus to, and in theſe ſufferings behold the great hatred of God to Sin.</p>
                     <p>By this Duty our reſolutions of Obedience would be <hi>ſtrengthened:</hi> For as the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſufferings of our deareſt Lord for our Intereſt, would encreaſe our <hi>Love,</hi> ſo would that <hi>Love</hi> fix and endear our Obedience.</p>
                     <p>By the frequent and devout performance of this Duty, our Souls would, through the Grace of God then conveyed to them in it, be <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened</hi> in a lively and <hi>active Faith,</hi> in a <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Love,</hi> in <hi>Divine Obedience,</hi> and in a <hi>Primitive Piety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As in this Duty our Souls are thus ſtrengthened, ſo are they <hi>refreſhed</hi> too by the comfortable Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of having renewed the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace with our God and Saviour; to the <hi>Conditions</hi> of which, if we ſincerely ſtand on our part, we are certainly intituled to Heaven, and Glory, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. We are <hi>refreſhed</hi> (as we before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) by the comfortable Hopes of Pardon of Sin, and of being reſtored to the Divine Favour; which we certainly then are, if we fail not of our part. Theſe are <hi>ſtrengthenings</hi> and <hi>refreſhings</hi> of the Soul, as great as any that can be given to the Body, by bread and wine.</p>

                        <hi>To examine themſelves, whether they repent them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE meaning is: All that come to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they hope to feaſt comfortably on the body and blood of their Saviour, and to partake of all the benefits of his Death and Sufferings, are to come daily prepared: And, to that end, are (as the Apoſtle adviſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.) to examine themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now this Examination is chiefly to be touching theſe Five things, which are here ſummed up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Anſwer. (1.) touching their <hi>Repentance.</hi> (2.) Touching their Reſolutions of a new Life, or <hi>Obedience.</hi> (3.) Touching their <hi>Faeith.</hi> (4.) Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Charity.</hi> (5.) Touching their <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Touching their Repentance.</hi> Repentance in ſhort is this; A change of Life, a turning from Sin to God, with Confeſſion and Contrition; a laſting, durable State of new Life and Reformation.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Touching reſolutions of a <hi>new Life</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> That is, a future, ſincere, univerſal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and perſevering diſcharge of all known Duty to our God, our Selves, and Neighbours: and where at any time we fail of perfection, through Infirmity, there inſtantly to riſe again, by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a greater diligence and watchfulneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) Touching <hi>our Faith.</hi> Faith in ſhort is this: Such a belief of Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel, as makes us ſincerely obedient to his Laws, and to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62664:70"/>We are to come with Faith in God's Mercy, that is, ſtedfaſtly believing, that for the ſake of our Saviour, our God will not fail to be reconciled to us upon Repentance, Reformation, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering future Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) Touching <hi>our Charity.</hi> Charity in brief is this, A ſincere Love of God, and of our Neighbour for God's ſake. Now this Charity is to ſhew its ſelf to our Neighbour, in a readineſs to <hi>Give</hi> and <hi>Forgive.</hi> To <hi>forgive</hi> Injuries, that is, all leſſer and more inconſiderable Injuries, ſo as to ſeek no ſatisfaction: In greater inſtances, or in conſiderable and inſupportable matters, though we may ſeek for legal Reparation from the injurious Perſon, yet we are ſo far to forgive, as not to ſeek it with ſpite, and rigour, and malice, and hatred, and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of gratifying our revengeful Humour. But ſtill to carry a treatable and friendly, a Chriſtian and charitable Diſpoſition toward the Perſon: And to be ready to make ſatisfaction to, and to ſeek a reconciliation with them, whom we have injured.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>giving</hi> to them of need; and in this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament never to appear before the Lord empty. In ſhort, to be charitably inclined to all Men, not only our Friends, but even our bittereſt Enemies; and not to be hindred from it by the difficulty of the Duty, conſidering the Example of our Maſter, and the Crown before us.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) Touching <hi>our Thankfulneſs and Devotion.</hi> That is, to come to theſe holy Myſteries, with a thankful remembrance of Chriſt's aſtoniſhing and moſt endearing Love, in dying for us: with a Heart, and Soul, and Mouth full of Thanks, and Praiſes, and Zeal, and Devotion, Divine Love, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Obedience; full of the moſt affectionate
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62664:70"/>admiration, that our God and Saviour ſhould do ſo much more for us fallen Men, than he did for the fallen Angels.</p>
                     <p>As for that <hi>unworthineſs</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, in not <hi>diſcerning the Lord's body,</hi> that conſiſts in theſe Four Things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>(1.) In not diſcerning it by Faith, from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meal, or from common food: Not diſcerning Chriſt's body in the conſecrated bread, and Chriſt's blood in the conſecrated wine.</item>
                        <item>(2.) In not by Faith diſcerning this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Jewiſh Paſſover, as ſome of the half converted <hi>Jews</hi> did not.</item>
                        <item>(3.) In not diſcerning Chriſt's body and blood in the conſecrated bread and wine, ſo as to come to it irreverently.</item>
                        <item>(4.) Not ſo to diſcern Chriſt's body, as to come to it with a remaining affection to ſin: with a known willful ſin unrepented of, unreſolved againſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly hatred and malice.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Theſe are the chief parts of unworthineſs.</p>
                     <p>So that if we examine our ſelves touching the Five things mentioned, (1.) Repentance, (2.) Faith in the Holy Jeſus, (3.) Reſolutions of a Chriſtian Life and a new Obedience, (4.) Our Charity, (5.) Our Thankfulneſs and Devotion; and find them in the Soul, though in lower degrees and meaſures; yet if we find there withal, deſires of having them greater, let us not then fear of eating and drinking our own Damnation, but ever come with a holy, chearful, humble and devout heart to this moſt heavenly Duty.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I briefly explained the Nature, and the meaning, and the benefits of the Two Sacraments, which are neceſſary for all men in general to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and which our bleſſed Saviour, a little before
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62664:71"/>he left this lower World, appointed and ordered to be continued by us in his Church, to the Worlds end; to be diſpenſed by the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to all believers, as the ordinary way and means to keep us in Covenant with him, and to convey Grace to his People. Accordingly he has appointed, and ſet apart a whole Order of Men, in ſucceſſion down from the Apoſtles, to adminiſter the Word, and both theſe Sacraments, to all faithful People, till his ſecond coming to judge the World.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, I mean <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which we are admitted into his Church: the <hi>Second</hi> of theſe the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> is the Sacrament by which we ſolemnly and thankfully own our having been ſo.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe is the Sacrament by which we are admitted to the Favour of our God and Saviour; the <hi>Second,</hi> is that Sacrament by which we are to continue our ſelves in that Favour.</p>
                     <p>Again, The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe is the Sacrament by which we are admitted and received into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, before we knew it; the <hi>Second</hi> of theſe is the Sacrament by which we renew and confirm this gracious Covenant with our God and Saviour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe the Sacrament by which we have a Title given us to a Kingdom of Glory; the <hi>Second</hi> is the Sacrament to which God mercifully invites us to ratifie, confirm and renew that Title of ours to a Crown of Life.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe the Sacrament by which we are <hi>new-born</hi> to Righteouſneſs; the <hi>Second</hi> of them is the Sacrament by which we are <hi>nouriſhed up</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe the Sacrament by which we are <hi>made</hi> Chriſtians, or Diſciples of the Holy Jeſus; the other, the Sacrament by which we ſolemnly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and own</hi> our ſelves to be ſo.</p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62664:71"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe the Sacrament by which we <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> our journey for Heaven and Immortality; the <hi>Second</hi> of them the Sacrament by which we <hi>continue</hi> it onward to the end of our days.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, ſeeing the firſt Sacrament, that of Baptiſm, was adminiſtred to us in our Infancy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we knew it; and we are now come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, far be it from us to withdraw our ſelves from the other Sacrament of our Lord's Supper, leſt we be found in any degrees to have <hi>renounced</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed</hi> our <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> or to have <hi>renounced</hi> or <hi>neglected the Communion of Saints.</hi> But as we happily <hi>begun</hi> for Heaven and Immortality, by the <hi>Waters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> ſo let us by our conſtant preparation, to receive the <hi>blood of the Covenant,</hi> and to attend on theſe holy Myſteries, <hi>keep pace</hi> with our Lord to the end of this <hi>our Pilgrimage</hi> here, till we come to meet him in his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing in our Baptiſm, when we were admitted into Covenant with God, we promiſed on our part Faith, Repentance, and a ſincere Obedience to him; but by reaſon of our Infirmities in this imperfect State, we have too frequently broken our Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it; Oh let us ever take all advantages and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of renewing it with our God again in the Sacrament of our Lord's Supper: ſtill labouring to grow from Grace to Grace, till all ſhall end in Glory.</p>
                     <p>And may we be ſo conſtant in our devout Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances on this Ordinance; ſo pant, and ſigh, and languiſh after the divine Grace and Favour, by our frequenting it, that as the Sacrament of Baptiſm was one of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Bleſſings we received in this World, ſo the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper may be one of the <hi>Laſt. Amen.</hi>
